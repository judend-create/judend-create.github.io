Happy New Year!

I’m truly grateful to God for letting me meet you this year.
Getting to know you has been such a pleasant surprise. you’re fun, easy-going, and genuinely enjoyable to be around.

In 2026, I hope you’re blessed with good health, a long life, and overflowing happiness.
I hope you’re always surrounded by kind people, because you are just as kind yourself.

I also hope that every problem from 2025 never finds its way into your 2026 — you don’t deserve any of that.
All my good prayers will stay with you throughout the year.

Once again, Happy New Year!
May today and all the days ahead become the best days of your life.
